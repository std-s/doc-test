# Values

## OpenMeeting's core values

### 🏗️ Build the best way to genal app.

This tells us what we are creating. It helps narrow our focus.

The best way to develop user interfaces enables developers to create applications fast.

The best way to develop user interfaces is extensible, so that we are not a barrier to developers.

### 🔎 Focus on the user and all else will follow.

Caring about the end user means having high quality support for accessibility, top performance, stability, high fidelity and compatibility with the user's platform, and so forth.

Caring about the developer means creating a joyful and productive development experience with quick iteration cycles, creating usable, simple, reliable, predictable APIs, and so forth.

We respect our users, whoever they are.

Another way to phrase this is "Build a thing people want".

### 📖 Openness

OpenMeeting is an open source project, in the full senses of the word: we are open to ideas, we are open to contributions, our code and our roadmap are open, our priorities are open. Transparency leads to a higher quality product. While the most active part of our team is currently primarily formed of employees from OpenIM, we are growing and welcome anyone to join the team; at this point, the majority of people with commit access are not part of OpenIM's OpenMeeting team. OpenMeeting's stewardship is managed by a team at OpenIM.

### 💫 Maintaining quality

A mediocre product cannot be the best way to develop production, so we must build processes around maintaining high levels of quality.

This manifests in various ways. One is that we are feature-driven, not date-driven: we do not plan work based on deadlines. We may sometimes host events where we announce new features, but these events will announce features that have become available, rather than the features becoming available in order to be announced. This means sometimes a feature we intended to announce will slip and not be announced, but we prefer this to announcing a rushed feature.

We may sometimes gate features behind flags until we are confident of their quality.

### 🤣‬ Have fun doing it

Last, but definitely not least, we want to make sure that our work environment is pleasant for everyone involved. Your health and the health of your family and friends is more important than OpenMeeting. Our community [is welcoming](https://github.com/openimsdk/open-im-server/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). We don't know everything; all of us can make mistakes.

We want team members to feel empowered to make changes to the code and to our processes.

We encourage a bias towards action. It's better to try something and be wrong, than to plan forever and never execute.
